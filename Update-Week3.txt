Week 3 (21/06/21 - 28/06/21)
1. Modified benchmark file(
   https://github.com/meshtag/gil/blob/Improve_buffer_update/benchmark/celero/convolve_2d.cpp)
   in accordance with instructions given by Olzhas.

2. Added benchmarks for testing with different kernel sizes.

3. Created this version(
    https://github.com/meshtag/gil/blob/Improve_buffer_update/include/boost/gil/extension/numeric/convolve_novel.hpp)
    and benchmarked its performance. 
    
4. Created this(

   flowchart for documenting my approach in current version. Its purpose is for easy review of
   code and should help us in keeping a record of different changes made for optimization.
